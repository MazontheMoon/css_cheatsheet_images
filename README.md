# CSS Cheatsheet - Text
 One in a series of cheat sheets I have created to teach myself coding and frontend development - this lesson is for styling images. The notes I have created are based on the teachings of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## User Stories 
As a student, I want to learn CSS, so that I can be a developer

As a developer, I want a cheat sheet, so that I can easily see which functions or values I can use for styling
